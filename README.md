# HackerRank
This is my repository for coding solutions on HackerRank. Remember, this is throw-away code that is only supposed to get the job done. It may not be the most optimal way to do these tasks.

I used the code stubs provided by HackerRank, so when you copy and run it on your computer/browser there may be some problems. To submit code on HackerRank, make sure you change the name of the public class to "Solution". Feel free to use my solutions in any way you like.

Here is the list of all the problems I did so far:
* Java (Basic):
  * Welcome to Java!
  * Java If-Else
  * Java Datatypes
